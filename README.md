Import the MySQL file "script.sql" in your database. 
The architecture of the database is now already created.

Watch out !!! The database configuration is local-based, with a "localhost" database server and an administrator ID without a password.
Be sure to modify and adapt the "config.php" file to your current configuration.

Then, run the index.php file and enjoy !
